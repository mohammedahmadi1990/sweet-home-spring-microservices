Created a Spring-based API for hotel booking with a RESTful web service that allows clients to interact with a hotel booking system. The API will manage hotel inventory, process bookings, and handle customer information. 

I did this as a sample assignment while working as a java assignment help expert at https://www.programminghomeworkhelp.com/java-assignment/.
 
 
 Key features include:
Hotel Inventory Management: Enabling hotels to list their rooms, amenities, and pricing.
Booking System: Allowing customers to search for available rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings.
User Authentication: Secure login for customers and hotel administrators.
Payment Integration: Facilitating secure payment transactions.
Review and Rating System: Enabling customers to rate and review their stay.
Leveraging Spring Boot for its simplicity and rapid development capabilities, the API will use Spring Data for database interactions and Spring Security for authentication. The project aims to offer a user-friendly and efficient way to book hotels, enhancing the customer experience while streamlining hotel management processes.
